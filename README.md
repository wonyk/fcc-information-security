## Free Code Camp Information Security Projects

This repository contains the source code for the respective projects for FCC Information Security course. Since there was a switch in the suggested platforms, some of the projects were coded and hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) while the more recent ones are hosted in [Repl.it](https://repl.it).

All projects are MIT licenced.
